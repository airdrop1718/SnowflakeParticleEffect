# Snowflake Particle Effect

This is a simple JavaScript code that generates a snowflake particle effect on a canvas.

## Description

This code creates a snowfall effect using HTML canvas and JavaScript. It generates multiple snowflake particles that fall from the top of the screen to the bottom, with a slight horizontal movement to simulate drifting. The snowflakes are randomly generated with different sizes and speeds, giving a natural and dynamic appearance.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enjoy the snowfall effect!

## Customization

You can customize the snowfall effect by adjusting the following parameters in the JavaScript code:

- `snowflakes`: Number of snowflakes generated.
- `radius`: Range of sizes for the snowflakes.
- `speed`: Range of falling speeds for the snowflakes.
- `sin`: Horizontal movement range for the snowflakes.
